      With artificial intelligence growing at an unprecedented pace, concerns regarding its environmental impact have started to emerge — but what if artificial intelligence is not just a part of the problem, but the technology that will lead us to the solution? Large language models, such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Anthropic’s Claude, or Facebook’s Llama, have become not only adopted by common people, but companies in automating redundant processes. However, every time one of these models generates a response, carbon emissions are released into our atmosphere. With climate change already a significant concern for the future of our planet, many environmentalists are warning us that the rate at which AI is improving will have disastrous impacts on our environment. Sasha Luccioni, a researcher at computer application company HuggingFace, stated that “Generative artificial intelligence uses 30 times more energy than a traditional search engine. I find it particularly disappointing that generative AI is used to search the Internet.” 
      But here is the uncomfortable truth: slamming the brakes on AI development because of the environment would be a massive mistake. Despite its costs today, AI may be humanity’s greatest tool to fight climate change and thousands if not millions of other problems in the future. As a former AI research intern at three different companies and a current student studying Computer Science at Cornell University, I have seen firsthand how artificial intelligence can push humanity toward solutions that may remain out of reach. As a member of Generation Z —76% of whom consider climate change to be one of their largest concerns—I am extremely concerned about climate change. Yet, I still believe that cutting AI development at its peak is harming our ability to help the very crisis we are attempting to solve. 
      ### Artificial Intelligence Is a Future Climate Solution
      Thinking about artificial intelligence as just chatbots or facial recognition systems is a one-dimensional approach, as AI has several use cases for things like energy grids, climate pattern prediction, and supporting conservation efforts. An excellent example of this is Google Deepmind’s research study where they successfully used AI to reduce the amount of energy used for cooling its data centers by 40% — an achievement that has a variety of applications across industries. At Stanford University, two professors programmed an AI model that could predict how high global temperatures would reach depending on the pace of decarbonization, something that can have various benefits in helping reduce the rate of climate change. These breakthroughs prove the potential benefit that AI can have in helping the fight against global warming. However, critics may say that relying on future technology advancements is speculative and does not solve the immediate problem. While that is true, the track record of past technological progress in computing shows how improved efficiency is not speculative; it's guaranteed. 
      ### Our Usage of Energy Will Become More Efficient
      As AI companies require an increasing amount of energy to run their model, they are seeking reliable sources of energy. ChatGPT receives approximately 1.5 billion visitors monthly — this consumes around 1 Gigawatt hours (GWh) daily, which is equivalent to the energy consumption of 33,000 US households. Researchers are considering how to mitigate energy consumption, with renewable energy standing at the forefront of balancing sustainability with scale. The most notable advocates for leveraging renewable energy to power AI data centers are the beneficiaries — technology giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. For instance, Google recently collaborated with Intersect Power and TPG Rise Climate to develop industrial parks that are powered by clean energy plants. Although exploring energy efficiency measures shows a promising future, there are journalists and ethicists shedding light on the challenges. Firstly, they argue that the intermittent nature of solar power can lead to reliability issues, especially during poor weather conditions or periods of high demand. Additionally, there is significant upfront investment required to transition from existing data centers, which may be difficult for regions with less developed energy infrastructure. However, advancements in smart grid technologies and energy storage have effectively mitigated concerns surrounding intermittency, while increasing awareness about renewable energy illustrates that the long-term economic benefits are overwhelmingly favorable. 
      ### Why US Leadership is Crucial For AI Governance and Our Climate
      If the United States prioritizes the climate over AI development for the next year, others will not hesitate to take the lead. Countries like China have already developed models neck in neck with the US's, yet they continue to rely heavily on coal and prioritize rapid industrial expansion over environmental protection. If they were to become the market leader in this space and started outsourcing models to other countries in the future, they would likely not consider more sustainable sources of energy like the US would. However, some argue that international collaboration, not competition, should drive AI development. While that would be great in an ideal world, geopolitical realities cannot be ignored. Without the United States having a stronghold over the AI market, countries with fewer environmental safeguards could dominate. If the US maintains AI leadership, it can set the standard for cleaner, more sustainable AI-powered infrastructure. The current Trump administration has announced a $500 billion dollar in the private AI sector which will continue to push the US towards stronger AI capabilities, but the potential end of the CHIPS act may allow our adversaries to match our semiconductor output that helps power these AI models. 
      ### Synopsis
      Artificial intelligence is not a perfect technology — far from it. However, when looking at the situation more holistically, stopping AI now could sabotage the very solutions we need for a sustainable future. Therefore, the real challenge is not halting the rapid growth of AI but steering it in the right direction. If done responsibly, AI could shift from being part of the problem to becoming a cornerstone of the solution. As the title suggests, we only need to turn a blind eye — for now.
